# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to compare the fares for each type of city (Rural, Suburban, Urban). We further summarized total rides, total drivers, total amount of fares, the average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver for each of the city types. We finally created a line chart with Matplotlib which compares the total fares by city type.

## Results

On the dataframe below, there is a clear trend depending on the type of city. Rural cities have less rides, less drivers, and less total fares, but the average fare per ride and average fare per driver. To the contrary, more urbanized cities have more total rides, more drivers, more total fares, but the average fare per ride and average fare per driver are lower.

The line chart below shows the trend of total fares by city type from January to May. From the graph below, one can tell that Urban areas always have a higher total fare amount, followed by Suburban areas, and lastly, Rural areas.

## Summary

Based on the data, one can assume that the disparity of total fares is caused by total rides. Possibly encouraging or promoting more rides for Rural travelers could increase its Total Fares. 

On another note, Total Fares and rides may be directly correlated with the amount of drivers in each city type. Advertising and incentivising for drivers in more rural areas may lead to an increase in drivers, thus increasing rides and total fares. 

Lastly, Pyber could increase the price per mile in Rural Areas to increase the fare per ride. Nevertheless, this is a risk and could cause a negative reaction by decentivizng riders from using Pyber.
